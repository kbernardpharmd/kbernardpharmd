- # Welcome to My Data Science Projects Repository

Hello! I'm Kim, a pharmacist with a passion for data science and artificial intelligence. As I navigate my journey from pharmacy to tech, I aim to leverage my background in healthcare to enhance pharmacy operations through data-driven solutions.

## About Me
- **Background**: I have extensive experience in pharmacy operations, having worked in retail and clinical pharmacy; and managed care. This background provides me with a unique perspective on the challenges and opportunities within the pharmaceutical industry.

- **Current Pursuit**: I am currently enrolled in a Data Science/AI program where I am developing skills in data analysis, machine learning, and programming. My goal is to integrate these skills into pharmacy operations to improve efficiency, enhance patient care, and facilitate data-driven decision-making.
